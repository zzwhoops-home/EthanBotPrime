was strung up on clay cutting wires, with walls surrounding them, using these walls to keep in the rocks with which they will be pressed. In addition to this all four limbs will be attached to boots (a medieval torture device that turbs your feet into jelly https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_(torture)) that are rigged up such that the harder one pulls on the boot, the harder they work their magic. To make this work, the boots will all be hooked to an old gray mare that will slowly walk away from him such that they are drawn and quartered. Since they are strung up on the underside with clay cutting wires that leaves ample space for them to flogged there. In addition the harness will be purposefully weak such that the weight of the rocks pressing them will force the harness slowly down into a pool of burning oil. In case you were wondering the boots will be securely attached to their upper thighs/upper arms so that even after they have been securely yeeted, the drawing and quartering may continue. For reference, the walls keeping the rocks in will have holes so that their arms/legs can get out, these holes will be just as big as their legs/ arms and be incredibly sharp, the old gray mares will be purposefully lead in different directions so that their arms and legs are forced up against the sharp edges severely lacerating them in a painful manner.

lost their arm to a nasty gunshot wound, and then had it replaced with a metal arm. Then they lost their legs in an explosion, and had them replaced too. Then they lost their other arm because they fought a chainsaw and lost. They had that arm replaced too. Then they had a car accident, causing a complete degloving of their face and a lose metal rod to puncture them in the heart. They survived, but eventually, all parts of their body had to be replaced with prosthetic ones. So are they really... themselves?
